## Notes
[+] If you face any problem at the installation process, check that: 
    
    1. You logged in as ROOT user not normal user 
    2. Check that you installed the GO language and this path is exist /root/go/bin  
  
[+] It will take almost 3 ~ 4 hours running if your target is a medium. So, be _Patient_ or use VPS and sleep while running :) 

[+] It will collect all the result into one directory with your target name
